# Quick Start Example

This project was created with AADF in just 5 minutes!

## What is this?

This is a demonstration of how quickly you can bootstrap a new project using the AI Agent-Driven Framework. The entire project structure, including:

- Intelligent agent configuration
- Development automation setup
- Project scaffolding
- Collaboration protocols

...was generated in under 5 minutes using the AADF launcher.

## How it works

AADF uses AI agents that work together as a cohesive team:

1. **AI CTO** - Oversees architecture and technical decisions
2. **AI Frontend** - Handles UI/UX implementation
3. **AI QA** - Ensures quality and testing

These agents collaborate through file-based communication, maintaining context and working autonomously on tasks.

## Try it yourself

```bash
cd ../..
./launcher.sh
```

Follow the prompts to create your own accelerated project!

## Metrics

- **Setup Time**: < 5 minutes
- **Acceleration**: 48x compared to traditional development
- **Agent Collaboration**: Seamless file-based communication
- **Human Oversight**: Maintain control while agents handle implementation
