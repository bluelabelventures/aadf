# DEPRECATION NOTICE

**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Status**: PAUSED - UNDER RECONSTRUCTION

## Important Notice

This version of AADF has been paused due to fundamental implementation issues:

1. **Missing Core Features**: The automation and AI integration features advertised do not exist
2. **Misleading Documentation**: Claims about autonomous AI agents are not implemented
3. **No Working Integration**: The orchestration system is disconnected from any AI services

## What This Means

- **Do not use this version** for production projects
- **Do not expect advertised features** to work
- The framework is currently just scaffolding without substance

## Next Steps

A complete reconstruction of AADF is underway that will:
- Include actual AI API integration
- Implement real task delegation
- Provide working automation features
- Deliver on the promised acceleration

## For Users Who Already Cloned This

If you've already set up a project with this version:
- The folder structure can still be useful
- The A2A messaging system works for manual notes
- Consider it a project template, not an automation framework
- Wait for v2.0 for actual AI features

## Timeline

New version development is starting immediately. Check back for updates.
